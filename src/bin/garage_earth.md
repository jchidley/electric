# Garage Earth Conductor (UK Standards)

## Overview

An earthing conductor is a conductor that connects the main earthing terminal to an earth electrode or other means of earthing, as defined by UK electrical standards.

## Key Characteristics

- Provides a low-impedance path to ground
- Must be able to carry fault current
- Should be protected against mechanical damage
- Must maintain electrical continuity

## Common Materials

- Copper (most common in UK installations)

## Installation Requirements (BS 7671)

1. Minimum cross-sectional area based on fault current
2. Proper mechanical protection
3. Adequate bonding to earth electrode
4. Protection against corrosion

## UK Standards

- BS 7671 (IET Wiring Regulations)
- BS EN 62305 (Lightning Protection)
- BS 7430 (Code of Practice for Earthing)

## Safety Considerations

- Regular inspection required (as per BS 7671)
- Must be accessible for testing
- Should be clearly identified with green/yellow marking
- Must be protected from damage
- Must comply with Building Regulations Part P

## Sizing

## UK Standards Format (BS 7430)

$A = \frac{I \sqrt{t}}{K}$

Where:

- $A$ is the cross-sectional area in mm²
- $I$ is the earth fault current in amperes (A)
- $t$ is the duration of the fault in seconds (s)
- $K$ is a constant depending on the material of the conductor

### K Values for Common Materials

From BS 7671 Regulation 543.1.3:
> "The value of k for a protective conductor shall be determined from Table 54.2, taking into account the material of the conductor, its initial temperature and its final temperature."

From BS 7671 Table 54.2:

- Copper: 143 (for initial temperature of 30°C and final temperature of 160°C)

## BS 88-3 C Fuse Characteristics

From BS 7671 Figure 3A1 (Fuses):
> "For a 100A BS 88-3 C fuse, the fault current is 580A and the fault duration is 5s. This is based on the manufacturer's data and BS 7671 requirements for protective device characteristics."

### Example Calculation

For a 100A BS 88-3 C fuse with fault current of 580A and duration of 5s:

1. Copper conductor:
   - Required size: 9.07 mm²
